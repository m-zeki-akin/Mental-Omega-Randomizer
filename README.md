# Mental Omega Randomizer Launcher

[![Security checks](https://github.com/Heinki/Mental-Omega-Randomizer/actions/workflows/security.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Heinki/Mental-Omega-Randomizer/actions/workflows/security.yml)

A Windows campaign randomizer for Mental Omega with standalone and Archipelago
0.6.7 play. It generates deterministic mission and reward plans, launches
campaign maps directly, tracks objective and victory checks, locks unearned
technology, and applies earned access and buffs through generated mission
copies.

## Disclaimer

I am *not* part of the Development of Mental Omega nor did I contribute in any way, all I did was access the game and the mapfiles to create the randomizer. Credits go to the Mental Omega Developers and their work!

## Quick Start

1. Make a **new, separate, fresh installation of Mental Omega**. Do not use the copy in which you normally install map packs, funmaps, rules edits, or other modifiers.
2. Start that clean installation normally once and verify that an original campaign mission launches.
3. Put `MentalOmegaRandomizer.exe` in that installation's root folder beside `MentalOmegaClient.exe`, `Syringe.exe`, and `gamemd.exe`.
4. Run `MentalOmegaRandomizer.exe`.
5. Choose the seed settings and press **Generate New Seed**.
6. Select an open mission and press **Launch Selected Mission**.
7. Complete objectives and win. The launcher records detected checks and applies earned rewards to future mission launches.

For multiworld play, also download the matching `mental_omega.apworld` and
follow [Mental Omega Archipelago Setup](Archipelago/SETUP.md). Never combine a
launcher and APWorld from different releases.

## Release Safety and Verification

No badge or antivirus scan can prove that any program is harmless. Releases use checks that make the build public and verifiable:

- GitHub Actions builds tagged Windows releases from repository source on a clean hosted runner.
- CodeQL scans Python source, and dependency review rejects newly introduced vulnerable build dependencies.
- Every release includes the launcher, APWorld, setup guide, release manifest,
  `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and GitHub-signed launcher build provenance.
- The complete Windows/Archipelago package build must succeed before a release
  is published.

Download only from this repository's [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Heinki/Mental-Omega-Randomizer/releases). Verify its checksum in PowerShell:

```powershell
$expected = (Get-Content .\SHA256SUMS.txt).Split()[0]
$actual = (Get-FileHash .\MentalOmegaRandomizer.exe -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLowerInvariant()
$actual -eq $expected
```

Expected result is `True`. With [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed, verify that GitHub built the exact EXE from this repository:

```powershell
gh attestation verify .\MentalOmegaRandomizer.exe --repo Heinki/Mental-Omega-Randomizer
```

Build provenance proves where the file came from; it is not an antivirus verdict. Microsoft SmartScreen may still warn about a new or unsigned EXE because file and publisher reputation are separate from malware detection. Do not disable antivirus. If Defender incorrectly detects a release, submit that exact release to [Microsoft Security Intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/filesubmission) as a software developer and include the resulting submission ID in the issue report. Authenticode code signing remains the next step for showing a verified publisher name.

### Supported game content

The Randomizer has been developed and tested against the **original Mental Omega campaign maps only**. Custom maps, funmaps, map packs, modified rules, and installations containing other gameplay modifiers are not currently supported. Those additions can redefine houses, units, weapons, triggers, and mission scripts in ways the Randomizer has not audited; combining them may produce incorrect rewards or progress, buff the wrong force, fail to launch, or affect the original content.

Using a dedicated clean installation is the same isolation normally recommended for map packs and other game modifiers. It protects the player's usual installation and gives bug reports a known baseline. The launcher does **not** modify Mental Omega's MIX archives: it reads the installed archives, creates a generated loose copy of the selected campaign map, and stores its own configuration, saves, logs, and caches outside the game folder entirely, in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MentalOmegaRandomizer\<installation>`.

**Mission List** progression opens the first three missions and adds one more after each victory. **Grid Mode** places the required missions on a compact faction-colored board: completing a node opens its orthogonal neighbors, and the bottom-right exit finishes the run after every required node is cleared. The off-by-default **Unlock all rewards after final Grid mission** option releases remaining seed rewards, grants every enabled unit/building/power unlock, and opens all optional Grid missions after that exit. Without it, unfinished rewards remain pending and optional missions retain ordinary neighbor locks/hidden-state behavior. Mixed-campaign seeds weight the short seven-mission Foehn campaign proportionally instead of allowing it to dominate the randomized order. The side-panel **Mark Mission Complete** recovery control is intended only when a completed mission was not detected.

## Early Development Stage

The launcher remains an early release. Source is organized as a domain package
with focused modules, but gameplay still needs broader live campaign coverage.
Features may be incomplete, behave incorrectly, or cause crashes.
Testing has focused most heavily on Allied missions, with less Soviet, Epsilon,
and Foehn live-play coverage.
For the Foehn faction the player will get Soviet/Allied tech instead as the Foehn Campaign does not have their own faction units.
In Chaos Mode you can get Foehn unit however.
Please report reproducible problems through the repository's [issue tracker](https://github.com/Heinki/Mental-Omega-Randomizer/issues).


## AI-Assisted Development

This project was developed with assistance from OpenAI's ChatGPT, including Codex coding assistance. AI tools have been used to analyze Mental Omega's INI formats, catalogue unit, weapon, projectile, and image tags for the UI, and support implementation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. Generated suggestions are reviewed, adapted, and validated against project requirements before inclusion. Final design decisions, releases, and project behavior remain the responsibility of the project maintainer.

## Documentation

Each document has one purpose so the same behavior is not maintained in several places.

| Document | Audience | Authoritative content |
|---|---|---|
| [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) | Contributors | Feature-to-file map, runtime flow, module boundaries, change rules, validation |
| [README_RANDOMIZER.md](README_RANDOMIZER.md) | Players and future Archipelago option authors | Complete settings tables, reward display, game modes, seed lifecycle, and user-facing limitations |
| [TECHNICAL_FINDINGS.md](TECHNICAL_FINDINGS.md) | Developers | Launch architecture, generated-map pipeline, objective/victory hook implementation, reward planning, tech locking, and buff safety |
| [configs/README.md](configs/README.md) | Maintainers and advanced users | Editable static mission, faction, reward, unit, and UI JSON configuration |
| [Archipelago/SETUP.md](Archipelago/SETUP.md) | Multiworld players and hosts | APWorld installation, YAML generation, connection, and artifact verification |
| `configs/player/mental_omega_randomizer.yaml` | Launcher/runtime | Saved standalone option values; it is data, not a second source of documentation |

## Developer Workflow

Run the launcher from source, starting in the Mental Omega folder:

```powershell
python RandomizerLauncher\launcher_gui.py
```

On Linux, create and activate a virtual environment in `RandomizerLauncher`,
install `requirements-runtime.txt`, then run the same entry point:

```bash
cd RandomizerLauncher
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-runtime.txt
python launcher_gui.py
```

Before packaging, compile every source module to catch syntax and import-time parsing errors:

```powershell
Set-Location RandomizerLauncher
python -m compileall -q .
python launcher_gui.py --self-check
```

Build the packaged launcher from the Mental Omega folder with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File RandomizerLauncher\build_exe.ps1
```

A Linux maintainer with Wine and a Windows Python 3.14.x runtime -- the
`build_exe_wine.sh` default expects it at `C:\Python3146`, override with
`WINE_PYTHON` -- can build the Windows launcher and matching APWorld
together:

```bash
cd RandomizerLauncher
./build_all_linux.sh
```

Set `WINE_PYTHON` to a different Windows Python executable when necessary. The
outputs are `MentalOmegaRandomizer.exe` in the Mental Omega folder and
`Archipelago/mental_omega.apworld`. Use `build_exe_wine.sh` only when an
EXE-only build is intentionally required.

Build both current local artifacts in one command with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File RandomizerLauncher\build_all.ps1
```

This writes `MentalOmegaRandomizer.exe` to the Mental Omega game root and
rebuilds the tracked `RandomizerLauncher\Archipelago\mental_omega.apworld`.
The individual `build_exe.ps1` and `Archipelago\build_apworld.ps1` scripts
remain available for focused packaging work.

Build the complete Archipelago release artifact set with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File RandomizerLauncher\build_archipelago_release.ps1
```

This creates the launcher, `.apworld`, setup guide, release manifest, and
checksums under `RandomizerLauncher\release`.

GitHub Actions installs pinned build dependencies from `requirements-build.txt` automatically. Only install them yourself when choosing an optional local build:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r RandomizerLauncher\requirements-build.txt
```

The build uses PyInstaller without UPX packing, embeds the release number as Windows version metadata, and embeds `mo-logo-puzzle-icon.ico`, an exact unscaled 32 x 32 crop from `mo-logo-puzzle.png`, as both the Windows executable icon and the running Tk window icon. Build dependencies are installed temporarily on the GitHub runner; maintainers need them locally only when choosing to build locally. Players do not need Python, build packages, the source directory, or a separate runtime folder. The launcher creates `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MentalOmegaRandomizer\<installation>` for configuration, saves, logs, and cached map/cameo data after it is run; this is writable player data, not part of the distributed application. It is kept there rather than beside the executable because a Steam installation sits under Program Files, where writing depends on running elevated or on Windows redirecting to VirtualStore, and where Steam's own file verification can remove it.

Run a packaged installation check without opening the UI:

```powershell
.\MentalOmegaRandomizer.exe --self-check
```

The report is written to `self_check.json` in the player data folder, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MentalOmegaRandomizer\<installation>`.

## Source Layout

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `launcher_gui.py` | Packaged/source entry point and self-check |
| `randomizer/application/` | Tk application composition; state, seed, progression, launch, and Unlocks controllers |
| `randomizer/config/` | Player YAML, static JSON loading, schema validation, and tuning adapters |
| `randomizer/core/` | Paths, storage, diagnostics, version, and collection primitives |
| `randomizer/launch/` | Spawn and option INI mechanics |
| `randomizer/maps/` | INI parsing, map pipeline, ownership, clones, buffs, hooks, settings, and powers |
| `randomizer/missions/` | Mission catalogue, house policy, access safety, and Tier 1 starters |
| `randomizer/progression/` | Grid topology and persisted progression normalization |
| `randomizer/rewards/` | Reward definitions, display, planning, roster, and weapon data |
| `randomizer/ui/` | Widget layout, settings panels, themes, tooltips, Grid rendering, and cameos |
| `configs/` | Editable static policy/templates plus ignored `player/` runtime YAML |
| `tools/` | Maintainer-only data generation |
| `build_exe.ps1` | PyInstaller build workflow |
| `build_exe_wine.sh` | Windows PyInstaller build through Wine on Linux |
| `build_all_linux.sh` | Combined Linux launcher + APWorld build workflow |
| `build_all.ps1` | Local launcher + tracked APWorld build workflow |

Packaged writable data lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MentalOmegaRandomizer\<installation>`; source-mode data lives under `RandomizerLauncher`. Earlier releases kept it in `RandomizerLauncherData` beside the executable; that folder is moved across on the first launch after upgrading.
Shop Gems and permanent unlocks live in `shop_profile.json`; the current run's
Ore, purchases, and mission state live in `shop_run.json`. Releases replace
neither file. Both use atomic writes and forward-compatible normalization, so
an update adds new defaults without resetting existing currency or purchases.
Every Python module stays below 1,000 lines. Public facades such as
`randomizer.maps.rules`, `randomizer.missions.safety`, and
`randomizer.rewards.catalogue` keep callers independent from internal splits.

## Troubleshooting and Bug Reports

Run `MentalOmegaRandomizer.exe --self-check` first. The result is saved to `self_check.json` in the player data folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\MentalOmegaRandomizer\<installation>`, named in its `install.txt`), and structured launcher diagnostics are kept in `logs\launcher.log` beside it. Objective and victory marker activity comes from the game's `debug\debug.log`.

When reporting a reproducible problem, include those files together with the mission code, seed, reward mode, and whether the issue also occurs on a fresh unmodified Mental Omega installation. Do not post `randomizer_state.json` publicly without reviewing it first; it contains the active run's seed and progress.

## Current Status

The standalone flow supports seed generation, campaign filtering, Standard and experimental Chaos rewards, direct spawned mission launch, objective/victory marker detection on many maps, tech locking/unlocking, positive buffs, allied-helper buffs, optional building-free offensive/secondary superweapons and aid powers, and installed in-game unit and superpower cameos.

The principal remaining limitations are mission-specific objective matching, a few allied-house safety cases, validation of game speed on more maps, and engine limits around isolating direct unit/weapon buffs when enemies use the same global type. See [Technical Findings: Known Limits](TECHNICAL_FINDINGS.md#known-limits) for the maintained list.
